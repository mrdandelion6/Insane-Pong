        <section id="who-i-am">
            <h2>who i am</h2>
            <p>i'm a second year student at the university of toronto, headed towards a triple major in computer science, physics, and mathematics. i know a "triple major" sounds excessive but i am extremely fascinated by all three of these fields and i love learning in general. in other words, i am a massive nerd.</p>
            <p>to tell you the truth, i decided to go into computer science on a whim as i was applying to university. initially, i was just interested in physics, but i decided to take some comp sci courses as well to see where it would go. i ended up realizing that i love computer science, and have been learning new things at a rapid speed ever since.</p>
            <p>then in second year i decided to take a few math major courses, encouraged by my friends, and also realized how cool math was. i especially learned how relevant math is in both physics and computer science (academic physics is literally an application of math). hence, i am now triple majoring. but that's all i'll say about school in this section, i'll leave the rest for later. i'm going to focus more on describing my personality now.</p>
            <p>if there was only one single character trait i could describe myself with, it would be hardworking. i don't think anyone is inherently a genius, or born talented. i believe that people reach that level because of passion and effort. this belief is the reason why i have been constantly pushing myself to try harder and harder at everything in life. i truly believe that if i try hard enough for long enough, i can make a lasting change on the world, and that is what i strive to do.</p>
            <p>it is my dream to change the world so profoundly that i leave an indelible mark of transformation, creating new technologies that further enhance humanity towards a more sustainable and peaceful future. i know it just sounds like some unattainable ideal, but that is truly what my goal is. not for the sake of fame or money, and not really even for humanity itself. rather, i want to do this just to prove to myself that i can.</p>
            <p>as you can tell, i am very ambitious. but i am not yet anything near the person i strive to be. all i can say in confidence is that i try my absolute best every single day, in everything i do. i hope to one day come back to this place after achieving my goals and read these words again. good luck future me.</p>

        <section id="interests-hobbies">
            <h2>interests and hobbies</h2>
            <p><span class="title2">programming in general:</span> i really enjoy using code to solve complex problems and analyze large sets of data. i find coding challenges very stimulating. i also love developing any kind of software and getting it to work, especially in a team. i have been very enthusiastic about every single project i have ever worked on to date and often end up adding several additional features along the way if allowed.</p>
            <p><span class="title2">physics and math:</span> so far, i've talked about changing the world a lot, but i am equally passionate about first understanding it. math is the language of the universe and physics is the story which uses said language to describe it. as such, i am extremely interested in both subjects. in physics, i am particularly fascinated with quantum mechanics and relativity, though my interest extends to classical mechanics, electromagnetism, aerodynamics, and astrophysics as well. in math, i am interesed in real analysis, topology, chaos theory, algebra, and calculus. i enjoy the proofs side of mathematics a lot more than the computational side.</p>
            <p><span class="title2">quantum computing:</span> quantum computing and quantum information science is infact what i want to one day pursue studying at graduate level, perhaps with a mix of machine learning. i am extremely interested in how quantum computers utilize superconductors and qubits to work and complete particular tasks several hundreds of times faster than conventional computers. i believe that quantum computers are the future of technology and will one day be made as feasible to produce and sustain as computers we have today. as such, coding with quantum computers may become one of the most prominent fields in computer science in the near future. i want to utilize my knowledge of both computer science and physics to one day help make advances in this field.</p>
            <p><span class="title2">machine learning:</span> artificial intelligence has always captivated me from a young age and now our world is finally making enough progress in this field for regular people to directly interact with it (chat gpt, bing ai). it is evident that machine learning will play a vital part in the future of technology. i believe that in the near future, we will be able to enhance artifical intelligence to a point where it can proficiently execute an extraordinary range of intricate tasks that would otherwise pose challenges for humans. i am extremely interested in researching machine learning and being part of the force that makes this happen.</p>
            <p><span class="title2">millennium problems:</span> i have been fascinated with the millennium prize problems for the past few years now, and i spend a fair amount of time researching them whenever i can. i know it's laughable, but i want to one day solve them. it is one of the goals of my life. as a physicist, i am particularly interested in the navier-stokes equations, which governs the flow of fluids. i won't get into the details of the problems, but i am just grateful that i exist before these problems have been solved.</p>
            <p><span class="title2">piano and guitar:</span> this entire time i have been talking about academic things such as coding, physics, and math, but there is actually more to me than that (surprise). i briefly played the piano for a few months a while ago and have started to pick it up again recently. i've never actually played the guitar but i am planning on buying one soon. though i'm not sure what instrument i think is cooler between the two, i really want to play and get good at both of them. sadly i dont have free to spare during university since i have a lot of courses to take as i am triple majoring. but whenever i do get any free time, i'll either be playing the piano or the guitar. i also have a hidden passion for singing. i'll go all out during karoake with any song i like, but i have never really tried actually practicing. also people have told me i sound tone-deaf lol.</p>
            <p><span class="title2">martial arts:</span> i absolutely love martial arts and have always wanted to consistently take lessons for muay thai somewhere, but it's just so expensive and i'm already collecting student debt. i've went to a few free sessions before, but other than that all i have done is practice in my garage or backyard watching videos online. i also want to learn brazilian jiu-jitsu for grappling after i learn muay thai for striking. once i save a decent amount of money i plan on finding a good muay thai gym. contact me if you know any good places :)</p>
            <p><span class="title2">cooking and food:</span> i actually cook a lot too, and am a big foodie. during university i get too busy to cook often, but i still cook a little now and then if i feel like it. i mostly cook indian, chinese, or italian cuisine. my most cooked dish is probably fried rice. my favorite food is either spicey chicken dumplings or lasagna. i also love seafood, but i've only really had fish and shrimp. the kinds of fish i've had include salmon, cod, haddock, basa, and of course tuna. i actually have a decently large list of foods i need to try. i've never had sushi! or crab, or lobster. when it comes to deserts, my favorite thing is probably mango ice cream. my mom makes it really good at home with real mangos. i love mangos in general, they're my favorite fruit. lastly, my favorite drink is easily coconut water. you either hate it or love it (you better love it). nothing is as refreshing as a long can of ice cold coconut water on a hot summer day. must have pulp!</p>
            <p><span class="title2">i love cats:</span> not much to say here but it is extremely important. i love cats. </p>
        </section>
        <section id="music">
            <h2>music i like</h2>
            <p>i could have put this in interests/hobbies but i felt like it deserved a whole category of its own. to be honest i never really cared much for music until i was 15, when i started finding the kind of songs i really liked.</p>
            <p>to me, the thing about music is that it is the ultimate encapsulation of emotions. music can portray feelings in their most raw and true form. even though i think plain words are the most effective way of communication generally, there are emotions you cannot express as deeply as you can with music.</p>
            <p>anyways, i always struggle to list the genres i listen to because there are so many and i forget, so i will list them here!</p>
            <ul>
                <li>pop-punk</li>
                <li>post-hardcore</li>
                <li>emo</li>
                <li>punk-rock</li>
                <li>indie-rock</li>
                <li>alt-rock</li>
                <li>rnb</li>
                <li>jpop</li>
            </ul>
            <p>to be honest, i wouldn't be able to explain each individual genre to you. i always end up mixing them up. anyways i listed them in descending order, starting with what i listen to the most (according to the bands i listen to).</p>
            <p>my favorite band is pierce the veil! in second place, it would probably be anarbor. other great artists i love are waterparks, the rare occassions, palaye royale, nirvana, sleeping with sirens, arctic monkeys, idkhbtfm, mcr, corpse, and joji. definitely check them out :). if you're curious let me know and i can give you my spotify! i have all the songs i listen to thrown together in one playlist.</p>
            <p>it's hard to say what my favorite song is really. i have quite a few i like. but if i were to have to choose just one, i would probably say emergency contact by pierce the veil. check out my playlist if you wanna know more, ask me!</p>

        <section id="life-plan">
            <h2>my life plan</h2>
            <p>as i've mentioned already, my life goal is to change the world for the better with technology. my current life plan is divided into 4 stages:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><span class="title2">undergrad studies: </span>i have four main goals during this stage. my first goal is to attain good co-op experience, whether it's single term internships or extensive year long positions (or longer). my second goal is to learn a lot from all my courses and graduate with a high gpa. so far my current cumulative gpa is 3.91/4.0 which is quite good. i want to raise this even further and graduate with a 3.95+ gpa. my third goal is gain a lot of research experience, and publish a lot of papers in fields such as quantum computing, machine learning, and chaos theory, or any other specific fields within comp sci, physics, or math really. my last goal is to create strong networks with professors and employers. all my previous goals will help me in doing so. if you've been reading this far and are interested in my skills as a researcher or employee, please contact me!</li>
                <li><span class="title2">after undergrad: </span>i hope to be employed by a company for several years immediately after completing my bachelor's degree. during this time i will simply be focused on working dilligently within the company that hires me and contributing my best everyday. perhaps i will stay with this company for life, but i will definitely stay for at least numerous years and save up a good amount of money.</li>
                <li><span class="title2">grad studies: </span>i am not really sure when i want to pursue graduate studies, but i plan to eventually. during this time, i would ideally like to continue working as well, so i will probably graduate slowly. i would preferably like to skip a master's and jump right into a phd for quantum information science or machine learning, but i know this will be very hard to pull off. the thing is, i plan on going to MIT for my graduate studies, so it will be quite difficult to get into. it all depends on how well i perform during my undergraduate years at university of toronto. not just my gpa, but also doing a lot of research, publishing papers, making connections with professors, and other things beyond just courses.</li>
                <li><span class="title2">after grad:</span> at this point, i'd want to take my career to the next level. i would try meeting all my end game goals of life here. i would spend a lot of time researching quantum computing, or machine learning, or maybe even some other fields within computer science, physics, or math. i want to revolutionize quantum computers and propel a huge advance in human technology. if i had made a good position for myself a company then i would ideally stay there while also working on my research at the same time. perhaps i will even teach as a professor at one point. one thing is for sure; this stage is the most uncertain part of my life. i am not sure how things will be at this point, but i have faith in myself to never stop trying my best to reach my goals, if nothing else.</li>

            <h2>courses i've taken</h2>
            <p>i'll update this section as i go through university. here, i'll be briefly talking about how i found each course and the academic decisions i made.</p>
            <h3>first year, cgpa: 3.91</h3>
            <div id="first-year" class="indent1">
                <p>for first year, i had no idea what to expect really. university was definitely lot harder than highschool, but my courses weren't too bad. i decided to take the standard 4 courses per semester. i planned on double majoring for computer science and physics, and my main focus of the year was to make cs post.</p>
                <p>fall:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>MAT102: 85 - intro to mathematical proofs, my first experience with proofs. everything in this course was new to me but it wasn't that hard.<p></p></li>
                    <li>CSC108: 81 - intro to computer programming, my first ever exposure to real programming. coding on paper for the final exam caught me off guard.<p></p></li>
                    <li>MAT135: 95 - calculus I, this is probably the easiest course i have taken at uni so far. <p></p></li>
                    <li>PHY146: 86 - principles of physics I, this is the course where i met my greatest academic enemy; lab reports.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>winter:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>CSC148: EXT - <span class="courseln">intro to computer science, my first exposure to recursion and OOP, also my most challenging course of first year. i didn't make cs post the first time i took this course, but i learned a lot. mainly of academic struggle for the first time in my life. </span><p></p></li>
                    <li>MAT136: 80 - calclus II, i walked into the exam hall with a 94 and left with an 80. i found this course quite easy, but i was not prepared for the exam. <p></p></li>
                    <li>ISP100: 83 - writing for university. i used to think i would never have to write an english essay again after highschool, but i was wrong. <p></p></li>
                    <li>PHY147: 85 - principles of physics II, this course was a lot more enjoyable than principles of physics I. but still had to do more lab reports!!</li>
                </ul>
                <p>summer:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>CSC148: 88 - took this course again to make post. this time i studied extremely hard and got in! <p></p></li>
                    <li>MAT235: 90 - multivariable calclus. i absolutely loved this class because of how much application it had to the real world.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h3>second year, cgpa: pending</h3>
            <div id="second-year" class="indent1">
                <p>after 2023 summer, i began working a lot harder at school. i began studying more and felt much more interested in learning stuff in general. perhaps it was mat235, or perhaps it just came on its own, but this was a big turning point in life for me. i decided to turn my double major into a triple major for cs, physics, and math and to take at least 6 courses each semester to push myself and become better at learning.</p>


                <p>fall:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>MAT240: SDF - algebra I, one of the coolest courses i have taken yet. i used friedberg, insel, and spence's linear algebra textbook and it was amazing. <p></p></li>
                    <li>MAT157: IPR - real analysis I, the hardest course i have taken at university so far. this course has changed the way i look at math. <p></p></li>
                    <li>PHY245: SDF - vibrations and waves. i finally got to properly learn simple harmonic motion (very cool). also got a headstart at differential equations. <p></p></li>
                    <li>CSC207: IPR - software engineering, i took this downtown with 7 other friends. got to work on <a href="">my first ever team coding project!</a> <p></p></li>
                    <li>CSC236: IPR - intro to theory of computation. i really loved the material of this course, but it was very poorly coordinated when i took it. <p></p></li>
                    <li>CSC258: CR/NCR - computer organization. learned to code in assembly and finally understood how computers even work in the first place.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>winter:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>MAT247: IPR <p></p></li>
                    <li>MAT159: IPR <p></p></li>
                    <li>PHY241: IPR <p></p></li>
                    <li>JCP221: IPR <p></p></li>
                    <li>STA256: IPR <p></p></li>
                    <li>CSC209: IPR <p></p></li>
                    <li>CSC311: IPR <p></p></li>
                </ul>
