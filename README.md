# faisals.me
A very simple HTML/CSS website I made as a place to introduce informally myself, just as a person.
Employers who are interested in getting to know me professionally should visit my main website, faisals.ca (repo link: LINK). 

This is the first website I have ever made and it mainly just consists of text about me. 
I go over the following:
- who I am as a person
- some of the interests and hobbies I have
- the kind of music I like and what my favorite bands are
- my current and long term life plan and goals
- all of the courses I have taken at UofT to date
