# [faisals.me](http://faisals.me)

A simple HTML/CSS website I made as a place to introduce myself informally. Employers interested in my professional background should visit my main website, [faisals.ca](https://faisals.ca) (repo link: [LINK](#)). This site also features an interactive pong game.

## Content

### About Me
This is the first website I've ever made, consisting mainly of text about me. Here are the topics I cover:

- **Who I am as a person**
- **Interests and Hobbies**
- **Music Preferences and Favorite Bands**
- **Current and Long-term Life Plan and Goals**
- **Courses Taken at UofT to Date**

### Pong Game
Users can also play an advanced version of pong I coded from scratch! 


## Features

### Scale Responsive Design
The site features a scale responsive design with navigation buttons in the top bar. They collapse into a tray icon when the screen width is less than 1280px. In this state, users can toggle a vertical pop-up menu by clicking on the tray icon, providing a clean interface. The pong game also adjusts itself based on the viewport's size.

### Single-Player
Users can select a single player option for the pong game if they would like to play alone.

### Multiplayer
Users can also select a multiplayer option, allowing up to 2 users to play against each other.

### Selection of Modes
- Single-Player features: `Easy`, `Medium`, `Hard`, and `Insane`.
- Multiplayer features: `Slow`, `Medium`, `Fast`, and `Blitz`.

### QoL:
- Customizable keybinds
- Pausing and resuming
- Draggable sliders for mobile
