# [faisals.me](http://faisals.me)

A very simple HTML/CSS website I made as a place to introduce myself informally. Employers interested in my professional background should visit my main website, [faisals.ca](https://faisals.ca) (repo link: [LINK](#)).

## Content

This is the first website I've ever made, consisting mainly of text about me. Here are the topics I cover:

- **Who I am as a person**
- **Interests and Hobbies**
- **Music Preferences and Favorite Bands**
- **Current and Long-term Life Plan and Goals**
- **Courses Taken at UofT to Date**

## Features

The site features a scale responsive design with navigation buttons in the top bar. They collapse into a tray icon when the screen width is less than 1280px. In this state, users can toggle a vertical pop-up menu by clicking on the tray icon, providing a clean interface.
