# faisals.me

A very simple HTML/CSS website I made as a place to introduce informally myself, just as a person. Employers who are interested in getting to know me professionally should visit my main website, [faisals.ca](https://faisals.ca) (repo link: [LINK](#)).

This is the first website I have ever made, and it mainly consists of text about me. The topics I go over are:

- Who I am as a person
- Some of the interests and hobbies I have
- The kind of music I like and what my favorite bands are
- My current and long-term life plan and goals
- All of the courses I have taken at UofT to date

The site features a screen scale responsive design with navigation buttons in the top bar that collapse into a tray icon when the screen width is less than 1280px. In this state, users can toggle a vertical pop-up menu by clicking on the tray icon, providing a clean interface.
